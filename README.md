# Foodriven
## Overview
This repository contains a group project developed as part of a master's program in Artificial Intelligence at ISEP, completed in 2023. This experimental project was developed to explore the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze restaurant reviews, identifying keywords associated with positive and negative sentiments, aiming to help restaurant managers understand customer feedback better by highlighting aspects that customers love or dislike.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Reviews were taken from Yelp's academic dataset.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to predict sentiment as positive or negative. 

3. **Keyword Extraction**: High-frequency words or phrases in each sentiment category are extracted to highlight prominent themes

# Usage
1. Open and execute `Foodriven.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment or in Google Colab.
2. Follow the steps described in the file.
